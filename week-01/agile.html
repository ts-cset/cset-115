# Morning Routine

Daily Journal:

Write down _everything_ you did from waking up till getting to class.

???
Exercise taken from: https://www.agilesparks.com/blog/wake-up-in-the-morning-game/

# Morning Routine

Step 2:

Get together into groups of five and batch similar tasks together under a common goal (e.g. Hygiene, Eating, Homework). Make a post-it note for each goal.

---

# Morning Routine

Step 3:

On the wall, order the goals in sequence from left to right, earlier to later, like a story of your morning.

---

# Morning Routine

Step 4:

Within each goal, place the activities in order of importance, most critical at the top and most optional at the bottom.

# Morning Routine

Step 5:

Here's the problem: your alarm didn't go off. You need to figure out how to change your plan to make it to class in 15 minutes. Rearrange your notes to reflect your new plan.

???
- Our goal is still to get full "value" out of getting ready.
- Can't get too deep into a single goal, get good enough and move to next goal.
- Maybe even drop a goal. It's still a story from end-to-end, though.
- Priotizing is easier with context.

.eight["Planning is everything.]

.eight[Plans are nothing."]

???
Field Marshall Helmuth Graf von Moltke
Planning was important because even though we threw our plan out,
we had to know what was important to keep on the new plan.

This doesn't mean it's growing over time, although it could be.
This just means there's more of a likelihood that the hurricane will
be in some unexpected place as time goes on.

???
Let's use our house example from yesterday. With blueprints in hand, it's more likely that
our estimate of done is more inaccurate than if we're almost done and just have to install
carpets, do some painting, and add the trim.

The waterfall process has critical paths, one team is blocked until the other is finished. This is a Gantt chart.

We iterate to **find the right solution**.

We iterate to **improve a potential solution**.

---

# Deliver Often

- *Potentially* shippable
- Sometimes trashed
- "Are we going in the right direction?"

???
Clients from yesterday, how would you feel if you weren't allowed to see
the final project until it was done? hopefully it'd be right. What about
seeing something in two weeks?

---

# Business Priorities

- Features delivered in order set by client.
- Features aren't tasks, they're user stories.

---

# Inspect and Adapt

- Retrospectives
- New knowledge affects new plan
- Not mid-sprint, but between sprints

---

# Product Lifecycle

- Product
- Release
- Iteration
- Day

# Practice Making User Stories

As a {type of user}, I want {goal} so that I {receive benefit}.

---

As a customer, I want to be able to create an account so that I can see my previous purchases.

# Practice Estimating

Instead of Story Points, let's look at Dog Points:

1. Make a small list of dog breeds

# Estimate Scales

count: false

# Ideal Days

How long is a game of football?

- Four 15 minute quarters
- Around 3 hours

---

# Ideal Days

- Ideal time is not Elapsed time
- Imagine all the things you do in a day that aren't developing the product

---

# Planning Poker

- Everyone gets a bunch of cards representing one of the values
- For a user story, everyone draws a card at the same time
- Compromise, if you can
- If not, try drawing cards again
