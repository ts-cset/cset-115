# Intro To Events

---

# Today's Goal

To understand concepts that allow us to start working with JavaScript events.

---

# Contents:

- [Higher Order Functions](#fns)
- [Array Methods](#arrays)
- [Synchronous Code](#sync)
- [Asynchronous Code](#async)
- [Handling Events](#events)

---

# DOM Manipulation

We learned how to:

- Find Nodes
- Navigate around the DOM tree
- Add and remove nodes
- Update their properties

--
count: false

...everything we could already do with HTML and CSS.

---

# DOM Manipulation

- These tools change the DOM _after_ it loads.
- When the code is on the user's machine.
- As a reaction to their actions.

name: fns

# Higher Order Functions

## .eight[A function that takes another function as a parameter, or returns a function.]

---

# Higher Order Functions

- Up till now, all our functions were First Order
- This "order" is a math thing...

JavaScript can do this because functions are First Class, meaning just like other values.

---

# First Order Function

```js
const add = function(x, y) {
  return x + y;
};

add(10, 4);
// &rarr; 14
```

---

# Higher Order Function

```js
const addX = function(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y;
  };
};

const addTen = addX(10);

addTen(4);
// &rarr; 14
```

---

# With Arrow Functions

```js
const addX = x =&gt; y =&gt; x + y;

addX(10)(4);
// &rarr; 14
```

- `() =&gt; {}`
- Parens optional for one parameter
- Brackets and return optional for one-line expression

---

# Abstraction

Higher Order Functions can replace unnecessary details or repetition.

- Log when function runs?
- Repeat some action in a loop?
- Do something to each element in array?

---
name: arrays

# Array Methods

Many methods follow this principle and are Higher Order Functions:

- .eight[Filter]: get the elements that meet a condition
- .eight[Map]: transform each element the same way
- .eight[Reduce]: calculate one value from all elements

---

# Array Filter

```js
const isEven = (n) =&gt; n % 2 === 0;

[1, 2, 3, 4].filter(isEven);
// &rarr; [2, 4];
```

---

# Array Map

```js
const square = (n) =&gt; n * n;

[1, 2, 3, 4].map(square);
// &rarr; [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

---

# Array Reduce

```js
const sum = (total, num) =&gt; total + num;

[1, 2, 3, 4].reduce(sum);
// &rarr; 10
```

---
name: sync

# Synchronous Code

Up till now, all our code has been run in sequence:

- Line 1 happens
- Line 2 happens
- Line 3 happens
- ...

---

# Synchronous Code

Even when we write .eight[blocking] code:

```js
const blocking = function() {
  alert("I'm in the way...");
  console.log("...now I can go.");
};

blocking();
```

---

# Blocking Examples

- Waiting for input
- Reading from files
- Sending/Receiving data over network
- Long calculations or loops

---
name: async

# Asynchronous Code

- Why wait for blocking code?!
- Do other things while we wait

--

.eleven[Time is hard.]

---

# Asynchronous Code

```js
const nonBlocking = function() {
  setTimeout(() =&gt; alert("I didn't block you"), 0);
  console.log("I'm in front!");
};

nonBlocking();
```

---

# Set Timeout

```js
setTimeout(action, milliseconds);
```

- Register some function to run after a time period
- Higher Order Function + Async = .eight[Callback]

---

# Set Timeout

```
setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log("hello"), 1000);
```
--

Will `alert()` still block this?

---
name: events

# Events

Events are added to a .eight[queue] structure to be handled when they can be.

- Timeouts and Intervals
- Clicks, Keypresses, Touch
- Scrolling
- etc.

---

# Events

Working with events:

- Create a .eight[handler], the function that will _handle_ the event
- Register it on the window or element to .eight[listen] for the event

--

# Event Objects

- Just like Errors and DOM Nodes, Events are objects
- Properties are based on the type of event
- The event object is given to your handler as a parameter
