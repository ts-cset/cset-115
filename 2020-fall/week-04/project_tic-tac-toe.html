      <h2>Project: Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>

      <p>
        This week, you and a partner will build the classic game of wits. A browser based game will give you more practice with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript working with the DOM. But it will also provide an opportunity to see how a team develops a single product.

      <h3>Setup</h3>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>One of you</strong> should go to GitHub and create a new repository called <code>tic-tac-toe</code>.</li>
        <li>Then go to the <strong>Settings</strong> tab and select <strong>Manage access</strong>. Click the green button to <strong>Invite a collaborator</strong> and enter your partner's GitHub username.</li>
        <li>Your partner should check their email and accept the invitation.</li>
        <li>Now both of you can clone the repo to your <code>code</code> directory.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Last week, we learned about different git workflows and realized we'd been following the Centralized workflow but without collaborators. We'll continue with this workflow for this project to see how it's different with other people. So no need to create forks or feature branches. Commit onto the <code>main</code> branch as usual, but this time you'll have to be more careful about pushing and pulling from the remote.
