# Waterfall

---

# All Projects Need A Plan

- Maps
- Recipes
- Blueprints

--

More complexity means more planning.

# Project Methodology

## .eight[The process by which a project is managed and developed.]

---

# Software Project Methodologies

There's too many...

- Waterfall
- Agile
- Scrum
- Kanban
- Scrumban
- Lean
- eXtreme
- Six Sigma
- PMBOK

# Plans Pre-Programming

.fourteen[Imagine you are tasked with building a bridge. What do you do?]

---

# Plans Pre-Programming

- Bridge for who? Or what?
- Over what?
- What resources do you have to build it with?
- Any other rules?

--

Before we can build it, we need to learn why we're building it.

---

# Gathering Requirements

- .eight[Deliverable]: What is being produced?
- .eight[Stakeholder]: Who has a vested interest in the project?
- .eight[Requirement]: What are the needs and wants?
- .eight[Constraint]: What are the rules that limit the project?

---

# Gathering Requirements

Potentially the most important question:

## .eight[What are our assumptions?]

---

# Design

Now that we have the project requirements, we can design a solution to meet them.

- .eight[Resources]: Anything needed to complete the project
- .eight[Milestones]: Break deliverable into phases
- .eight[Budget]: Estimate of total cost
- .eight[Scope]: Total of all essential work

---

# Design

If a solution fails on paper, that's a lot better than a solution failing in real life.

---

# Implementation

A plan has been made, time to follow it!

--

Simple. Go build the bridge.

---

# Testing and Maintenance

- Did it work?
- Are all the requirements met?
- How do you keep it working?

---

# Waterfall Method

.eight[One phase needs to be completed before moving to the next.]

1. Requirements
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Maintenance

# Plans For Programming

Different types of companies:

- Deliverable: Agency vs Product Team
- Structure: Start-up vs Enterprise

# Project Architecture

- What languages we need to write the code
- What frameworks we could use to write less code
- What paradigms/styles we should use to keep our code consistent
- What platforms or hardware our code will run on
- How we'll deliver the code to customers
- How we'll maintain the service over time

---

# Project Design

- Graphic Design
- User Interface Design
- User Experience Design

---

# Project Design Deliverables

- Moodboards
- Focus Group Results
- Wireframing
- Mocks/Comps
- Prototyping
