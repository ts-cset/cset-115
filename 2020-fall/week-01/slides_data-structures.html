# Data Structures

---

# Today's Goal

To understand why data structures exist and how we can model the real world in code.

---

# Contents:

- [Review JS Data Types](#types)
- [Object Oriented Programming](#oop)
- [Built-In Objects](#built-in)
- [What Is A Data Structure](#data-structure)

# JS Data Types

- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Empty value
--
count: false
- Function
--
count: false
- Object
--
count: false
  - Array

---

# Objects

```js
const dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  bark: function() {
    console.log("woof!");
  }
};
```

```js
console.log(dog.name);
// &rarr; "Spot"

dog.bark()
// &rarr; "woof!"
```

---

# Objects

## .eight[A generic collection of properties, key-value pairs.]

---

# Objects Elsewhere

One of the most common data structures

- Python: "Dictionaries"
- PHP: "Associative Arrays"
- Ruby, Perl: "Hashes"
- Java, C++, and others: "Maps"

[Wikipedia: Associative Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array)

---

# Strings

```js
const greeting = "hello";

console.log(greeting.length);
// &rarr; 5

greeting.toUpperCase();
// &rarr; "HELLO"
```

--
count: false

String? or Object?

class: middle, center

# .fourteen[It's a String.]


---
name: oop

# Object Oriented Programming

- Next semester
- Generic Idea vs Specific Example
- .eight[Class] vs .eight[Instance]

```js
String

const str1 = "Alpha";
const str2 = "Beta";
```

---

# Object Oriented Programming

Remember all those capitalized variables?

- `String`
- `Number`
- `Boolean`
- `Function`
- `Object`
- `Array`
- `Math`
- `Date`

---

# Object Oriented Programming

## .eight[The capitalization is letting you know it's one of these special objects.]

---

# Prototypes

- JavaScript isn't truly Object-Oriented
- It's .eight[Prototypical]

--

But it's close enough.

---
name: built-in

# Built-In Objects

## [MDN Prototypes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects) 

If you haven't already, go look at the page for each of our primitive data types.

---

# Built-In Objects

Some new ones:

- Error
- Date
- RegExp

name: data-structure

# What Is A Data Structure?

_"A data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data."_

[Wikipedia: Data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)

---

# What Is A Data Structure?

Defines:

- How to .eight[store] the data
- How to .eight[interact] with it

--

## .fourteen[A way to represent the real world in code.]

---

# Array

- A container that holds indexed values
- Functions:
  - Add values to either side
  - Remove values from either side
  - Find the position of a value
  - Iterate over values in order
  - Split or join values
  - etc.

---

# Set

- A container that holds unique values
- Functions:
  - Add values
  - Remove values
  - Check if value exists
  - Iterate over values in order

---

# Set vs Array

- Arrays can contain duplicate values
- Array elements can be accessed using integer indexes

[MDN: Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)

---

# Map

- A container that holds keyed values
- Functions:
  - Set key's value
  - Get key's value
  - Check if key exists
  - Remove key

---

# Map Examples

- Phone or Address Book
- Dictionary
- Database

---

# Map vs Object

- Before Maps existed, you just used Objects
- But Objects are too generic
- Maps are specialized for this purpose

[MDN: Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)

---

# But Why?

If we can do the same things using regular Arrays and Objects, why have Sets and Maps?

--

Because they make things easier.

---

# Data Structures

The goal is to pick the right data structure for the situation.

--
count: false

.fourteen[But what if there isn't one?]

name: custom

# Make Your Own Data Structures

Here are common structures that JS doesn't have:

- Linked List
- Queue
- Stack
- Tree

---

# Linked List

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list">Wikipedia: Linked List</a>

Examples:

- Train or subway cars
- Christmas lights
- Effects pedals for a guitar


---

# Queue

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)">Wikipedia: Queue</a>

Examples:

- Line of customers
- Network requests
- Messages
- JavaScript events

--

.eight[First In, First Out]

---

# Stack

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)">Wikipedia: Stack</a>

Examples:

- Pile of books
- Email inbox
- Undo or back button history
- JavaScript function calls

--

.eight[First In, Last Out]

---

# Tree

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">Wikipedia: Tree</a>

Examples:

- Family tree
- Company Hierarchy
- File system
--

count: false
- Document Object Model

---

# DOM

- A tree-like data structure built by the browser
- Functions:
  - Adding nodes
  - Removing nodes
  - Navigating the tree
  - Finding nodes in the tree
  - Altering properties of the node
