      <h3>Project:</h3>
      <p>
        This project is a little different. Being a professional developer isn't always about building new solutions, it's often about going back to improve on old ones. So this project is up to you. Pick a project from the recent week's that you want to improve. Take a few minutes to write a list of what could be improved and then post it to your group's channel in Slack.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you get a thumb's up from me, it's a quality idea. I might also reply to it with some other things you want to think about. Then it's up to you to give it a shot! Don't start from scratch, try to "refactor" the existing code (look it up if you don't know what that word means).
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>By Monday morning</strong>, reply to your original list with your progress. Share a link to the code if you can. Did you complete your goals? If you did, how so? If you didn't, what prevented you? I'm grading this project as a simple letter grade based on the level of effort you put in to learn new things and improve on your own.
      </p>
      

      <h3>Assessment:</h3>
      <p>Follow these <a href="https://ts-cset.github.io/first-year/policies/assessments/">guidelines</a> to answer the following questions. Due at the end of class on Friday, October 23<sup>rd</sup>. <strong>Remember this is CSET-115</strong>, so your file should be at the following path: <code>cset/115/assessment-1.md</code>.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Now that you've spent a few weeks working on longer projects, how do you think you'll adapt to working in the professional world?</li>
        <li>Imagine you are building your Choose-Your-Own-Adventure project in JavaScript for the browser. The user has clicked a button to select which room to enter, walk through how you would manipulate the page to show the next room's description. Explain the DOM methods you would use and why.</li>
        <li>Why are different data structures useful? Use the Document Object Model as an example. Would it work as any structure other than a tree?</li>
      </ul>
