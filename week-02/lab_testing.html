    CSET-110 Lab:<br>
    Automated Testing
  </h1>

  <p>
    Time to practice writing tests!
  </p>

  <p>
    Go through the list of functions we wrote for the lab on <a href="https://github.com/ts-cset/js-functions/blob/master/index.html">Simple JS Functions</a>. Using TDD, make a test for each function listed and then write the correct function in order to make the test pass. Each function should have as many tests to test all the possible outputs.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, the <code>isEven</code> function should have a test that results in <code>true</code>, a test that results in <code>false</code>, and also a test that deals with a non-numeric input.
