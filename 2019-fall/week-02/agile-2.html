# Agile: Part Two

---

Agenda

- Planning for Value
- Executing the Plan
- Monitoring Progress

---

# What is Value?

---

*noun*

# .eight[the regard that something is held to deserve]

---

# Who values your code?

---
count: false

# Who values your code?

- you.

---

# Who values your *features*?

---
count: false

# Who values your *features*?

- you
- your boss
- your client
- your users

# .eight[Stakeholders]

---
class: middle, center

So you wrote a bunch of user stories.

# .eight[Now what?]

---
class: middle, center

# How do you prioritize features?

---
count: false
class: middle, center

# *What is the value of a feature?*

---

Feature Value can be measured in

- Cost
- Risk
- Benefit

---

# Financial Prioritization

The typical .eight[Cost/Benefit] analysis.

We'll skip this for now.

???
You're students, not employers. You're not getting paid to code,
or paying people to code, or getting paid for your code.

# Risk Prioritization

- Agile is built for risk management
- Let's do a .eight[Risk/Benefit] analysis

# Benefit Prioritization

- Kano Model of Customer Satisfaction
- User's perspective
- Imagine you're booking a hotel room. What features should it have?

---

# Types of Features:

- Must Haves
- The More, The Better
- Exciters and Delighters

# .eleven[Warning:]

.eleven[Exciting features become]

### .eleven[Must Have]

.eleven[features over time.]

---

# More Benefit Prioritization

- Pareto Principle
- "Roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes"
- Basically, use your time **shrewdly**

---
class: middle, center

So you prioritized all your user stories.

# .eight[Now what?]

---

# Executing the Plan

- Example Mapping
- Stand-Ups
- Kanban

---

# Example Mapping

- Turn a User Story into an Acceptance Test
- "What does success look like?"
- Create examples to define rules
- Removes unknown

# Common Swimlanes

- .eight[Backlog:] all the stories that haven't been completed yet, roughly estimated and prioritized
- .eight[To Do:] the stories scheduled for this sprint, now example mapped
- .eight[Doing:] only *one* story per person on the team
- .eight[To Review:] optional, a finished story that needs team approval to be merged
- .eight[Done:] completed and merged into a release
